Create a website named "Kira" on Replit that serves as an online platform for beauty products, with a primary focus on hair care solutions for women, designed to be especially appealing and familiar to girls. The website should have a clean, modern, and youthful design and include the following elements:

A header with a navigation bar that includes a logo (titled "Kira") on the left and navigation links on the right, such as "Home," "Products," "About," and "Contact." The navigation should be fixed at the top of the page and visible on all screens, with a playful yet elegant style that resonates with a younger female audience.
A hero section below the header that serves as the main landing area. This section should feature a full-width background image (or a placeholder image) related to hair care, overlaid with a semi-transparent gradient for text visibility. The hero should contain a headline like "Discover Premium Hair Care Products," a short, engaging description, and a prominent call-to-action button labeled "Shop Now" that feels fun and inviting to girls.
A products section that displays a grid of product cards. Each card should include an image (use a placeholder if needed), a product title (e.g., "Revitalizing Shampoo"), a brief, catchy description, and a "Buy Now" button. The design of the cards should be vibrant and trendy, appealing to girls, with colors and imagery that feel fresh and relatable. The grid should automatically adjust to fit different screen sizes, ensuring a responsive layout.
An about section that provides information about the brand, such as a paragraph explaining that Kira is dedicated to providing high-quality, stylish hair care solutions for women, with a special emphasis on products that girls love. The tone should be friendly, empowering, and relatable to a younger female audience.
A contact section with a form that allows users to send messages. The form should include fields for name, email, and message, along with a submit button. The form should be centered on the page, easy to use, and designed with a lighthearted, approachable look that girls will find inviting on any device.
A footer at the bottom of the page with a simple copyright notice, such as "Â© 2023 Kira. All rights reserved," styled in a way that complements the youthful and feminine aesthetic.
Use CSS to style the website with a consistent color scheme (e.g., soft pinks, purples, or pastels with accents of a bold, trendy color like coral) and ensure the design is visually appealing, trendy, and familiar to girls. The typography should be clear, modern, and playful, using a sans-serif font that feels fresh and fun.
Include JavaScript to add basic interactivity, such as smooth scrolling for navigation links or hover effects on buttons, keeping it simple but engaging for a younger audience.
Ensure the entire website is responsive and mobile-compatible. Use techniques like media queries, flexible grids, and relative units (e.g., percentages, rems) to make sure the site looks great on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The navigation should collapse into a hamburger menu on smaller screens if necessary, designed in a way that feels intuitive and stylish for girls.
Tailor the overall look, feel, and content to be familiar and appealing to girls, using imagery, language, and design elements that resonate with their interests and preferences in beauty and hair care.
