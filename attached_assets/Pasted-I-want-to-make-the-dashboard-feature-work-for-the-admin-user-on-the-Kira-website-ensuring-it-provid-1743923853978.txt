I want to make the dashboard feature work for the admin user on the Kira website, ensuring it provides a comprehensive overview of everything happening on the site. The dashboard should show detailed information about orders, users, money, and any other possible metrics or data that suit this feature. Here’s what to do:

Dashboard Functionality: Enhance the admin dashboard (accessible only to the admin user) to display a complete set of data and tools. The dashboard should include the following sections:

Orders: Show all orders placed by normal users, including details like product names, quantities, order dates, user information (e.g., name, email), and order status (e.g., pending, shipped, completed). Provide options for the admin to view, edit, or cancel orders.
Users: List all registered normal users, displaying their usernames, emails, registration dates, and any additional profile information. Include the ability for the admin to search, filter, or export this data if needed.
Money/Revenue: Track and display financial data, such as total revenue, individual order amounts, and any payment statuses (if payment processing is implemented). If payments aren’t yet integrated, show placeholders or estimates based on order values. Include charts or graphs (e.g., bar charts for revenue over time) to visualize this data in a clear, easy-to-understand way.
Other Metrics: Add any other relevant information, such as site traffic (if tracked), product popularity (e.g., most viewed or purchased items), user feedback, or system alerts (e.g., low stock warnings). Make the dashboard as comprehensive as possible to give the admin a full picture of site activity.
Management Tools: Include interactive tools within the dashboard, such as buttons or forms to add new products, update existing products, manage user accounts (e.g., block or delete users), or generate reports. Ensure these tools are user-friendly and visually consistent with the current girl-friendly design.
Design and Usability: Ensure the dashboard has a clean, modern look that matches the site’s girl-friendly aesthetic, using the improved font format, soft colors (e.g., pinks, purples, pastels), and trendy styling. Organize the data into clear sections with headings, tables, charts, and buttons that are easy to navigate. The layout should be intuitive, with key information highlighted and secondary details collapsible or expandable.

Responsiveness and Mobile Compatibility: Make sure the dashboard is fully responsive and mobile-compatible, adjusting seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, smartphones). Use media queries, flexible grids, and relative units to ensure all data and tools are accessible and legible on any device. On smaller screens, consider using tabs, accordions, or a hamburger menu to manage space while keeping functionality intact.

Security: Reinforce security for the dashboard, ensuring only the admin user can access it. Use role-based access control and encryption to protect sensitive data like orders, user information, and financial details. Add a logout feature and session management to prevent unauthorized access.

Data Integration: Pull data from the existing database (e.g., user accounts, product details, orders) and present it in real-time or with minimal delay. If any data isn’t yet tracked (e.g., money or analytics), set up placeholders or basic tracking systems that can be expanded later.

Testing: Once the dashboard is complete, test it thoroughly to ensure all features work correctly. Let me know how I can access and test the dashboard as the admin user, including any steps to view orders, users, money, and other metrics. Verify that the dashboard performs well on all devices and that the data is accurate and secure.

This feature will give the admin a powerful tool to manage the Kira website effectively, keeping it engaging and functional for both admins and normal users while maintaining its appeal to girls.
